# HTML header and footer

My go to HTML5 header and footer template.

Defines the following:

- HTML5 doctype.
- Character encoding as `utf-8`.
- Ensure Internet Explorer versions use their latest browser engine, via the [`http-equiv="X-UA-Compatible"`](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/6771258/what-does-meta-http-equiv-x-ua-compatible-content-ie-edge-do) meta header.
- Set a `viewport` that works well with responsive page layouts.
- Page title and description.
- Favicon(s).
- Example CSS and JavaScript loading.
